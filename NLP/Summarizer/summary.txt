In an attempt to scale up its AI portfolio, Apple has acquired Spain-based AI video startup — Vilynx for approximately $50 million.
Reported by Bloomberg, the AI startup — Vilynx is headquartered in Barcelona, which is known to build software using computer vision to analyse a video’s visual, text, and audio content with the goal of “understanding” what’s in the video.
Apple told the media that the company typically acquires smaller technology companies from time to time, and with the recent buy, the company could potentially use Vilynx’s technology to help improve a variety of apps.
According to the media, Siri, search, Photos, and other apps that rely on Apple are possible candidates as are Apple TV, Music, News, to name a few that are going to be revolutionised with Vilynx’s technology.
The purchase will also advance Apple’s AI expertise, adding up to 50 engineers and data scientists joining from Vilynx, and the startup is going to become one of Apple’s key AI research hubs in Europe, according to the news.
